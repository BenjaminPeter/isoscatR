# What is scatR?

scatR is an R package that implements smoothed and continuous assignment testing (SCAT) of genetic samples. These methods allow a researchers to infer smoothed allele frequencies across space using a Bayesian Gaussian process model fit to samples with known origin. Additionally, the package implements methods for the probabilistic estimatation of the spatial origin of samples using their genotypes.

# Installation

The package can be installed in the standard way `R CMD INSTALL scatR`. Note that this package depends on a reasonably current install of Boost, anything >=1.47 should be fine. If you want to take advantage of the GPU accelerated features both Magma (>=1.1) and CUDA (>=4.3) must be installed along with a NVIDIA graphics card with a [compute capability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs) of 2.0 or better.

Documentation is forthcoming.
